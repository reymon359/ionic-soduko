            It all started some time ago when I was trying to create an algorithm
            that would create random perfect sudoku boards.
          </p>
          <p text-left>
            Then I learnt Ionic by myslef from a course made by Fernando Herrera
            and I wanted to create something with it and thought of using some of the
            code I had wrotten for the algorithm to create a sudoku game.
          </p>
          <p text-left>
            And thats all, some cups of coffe later I made this game. I hope you enjoy
            solving some sudoku games and dont doubt of sharing it if you like it :)

          <!-- <p> Here is an example of a Sudoku board:</p>
          <div text-center>
            <ion-img width="200" height="200" src="/assets/imgs/rules/sudoku.svg"></ion-img>
          </div>
          <p>And this would be the solution to previous board:</p>
          <div text-center>
            <ion-img width="200" height="200" src="/assets/imgs/rules/sudokusolved.svg"></ion-img>
